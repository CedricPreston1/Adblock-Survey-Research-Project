# Adblock-Survey-Research-Project

Ad block survey that I cleaned and Analyze. The data came from Kaggle, and the author of the data simplified the columns into words like kab_3. 

They did give what these columns actually mean (kab_3 :  'I know that ad blockers reduce risk of viruses and malicious software' as an example) 

I also created a bar graph based on age and sex and found that younger males are more likely to admit that they're currently using an adblocker

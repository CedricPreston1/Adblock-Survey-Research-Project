# Adblock-Survey-Research-Project
Ad block survey that I cleaned and Analyze. The data came from Kaggle, and the author of the data simplified the columns into words like kab_3. They did give what these columns actually mean (kab_3 :  'I know that ad blockers reduce risk of viruses and malicious software' as an example)

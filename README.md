# Adblock-Survey-Research-Project

Ad block survey that I cleaned and Analyze. The data came from Kaggle, and the author of the data simplified the columns into words like kab_3. 

They did give what these columns actually mean (kab_3 :  'I know that ad blockers reduce risk of viruses and malicious software' as an example) 

I also created a bar graph based on age and sex and found that younger males are more likely to admit that they're currently using an adblocker

Where I got the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmetcgl/ad-blockers-to-use-or-not-to-use/data 

Update, I've made a dashboard on Looker that details things section by secion, you can check it out here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/05d95942-a6de-4a53-882e-6f9f66c55ff4 

To conclude: I've determined that Sex and age barely has an effect on the answers given, only that if the participant was a younger male, That participant is more likely to admit that they are using an ad blocker.

Other things to observe: Participants generally do not like ads, though many of them agree that it helps with economic development as well as development of a business, this does include younger male participants who

may have admitted to useing an ad blocker. 

Many participants also feel that advertisements are not really giving valid information regarding products. 

I would like to find the company or organization who organized this survey but I think that would be stretching it.
